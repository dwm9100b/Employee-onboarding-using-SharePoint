This Power App was created to allow someone to easily recreate a project. While videos are great, it is important for the one learning to be able to follow exact steps that only text can provide.

This Particular app will show you the steps needed to recreate an Employee Onboarding system that was presented on Collab365.com by Kelly Edinger.

There are a couple of my own additions and rearranging of steps so as to be more logical.

I hope this will be a valuable resource along with Kelly's workshop video.

Couple of items regarding this app:

- It is fully self-contained, no remote data store to pull from
- Your progress is saved between sessions
- You can reset a step or your entire progress
- Only 1 screen was used, I hate screen navigation flicker
- Uses experimental feature for Save/Load within web player

Note this is a tablet app and not intended to be used on a phone

To use:

1. Download the zip in the App folder
2. From within your PowerApp studio
3. Select Apps in the left nav
4. From the top nav, select Import canvas app
5. Follow the prompts
6. Once imported, just run the app

Enjoy,

Dale
