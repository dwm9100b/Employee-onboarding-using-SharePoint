    <p style='margin-top: 0px;'>This Power App was created to allow someone to easily recreate a 
    project. While videos are great, it is important for the one learning to be able to follow 
    exact steps that only text can provide.</p>
    <p>This Particular app will show you the steps needed to recreate an Employee Onboarding system that was presented on Collab365.com by Kelly Edinger.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of my own additions and rearranging of steps so as to be more logical.</p>
    <p>I hope this will be a valuable resource along with Kelly's workshop video.</p>
    <p>Couple of items regarding this app:<br/></p>
    <ol>
        <li>It is fully self-contained, no remote data store to pull from</li>
        <li>Your progress is saved between sessions</li>
        <li>You can reset a step or your entire progress</li>
        <li>Only 1 screen was used, I hate screen navigation flicker</li>
        <li>Uses experimental feature for Save/Load within web player</li>
        <li>Note this is a tablet app and not intended to be used on a phone</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy,<br/>
        Dale</p><br/>
