       <p style='margin-top: 0px;'>So let's go thru how this is all supposed to work...</p>
       <p>What are the different lists used for?</p>
       <dl style='margin-left: 30px;'>
          <dt>
             <b>WFOnboardingTasks</b></dt>
          <dd>Tasks get added to this list for internal staff members/groups to accomplish <br>
            for onboarding a new employee. This is not for tasks to be assigned to the new hire.<br> 
            Think of this as task templates for staff. Staff will be maintaining this list. <br>
            Does not kick off any flow.</dd>
          <br/>
          <dt>
             <b>WFEmployeeOnboardingTasks</b></dt>
          <dd>As the name indicates, these will be the tasks that will be assigned to the new hire. <br>
            Also think of these as task templates, only these are for the new hires. <br>
            Staff will also be maintaining this list. Does not kick off any flows.<br/></dd>
          <br/>
          <dt>
             <b>WFOnboardingEmailTemplates</b></dt>
          <dd>This list holds email templates for different stages of the onboarding. <br>
            Staff will be responsible for adding/updating the content of this list. <br>
            No flows will be kicked off from this list.</dd>
          <br/>
          <dt>
             <b>OnboardingInputForm</b></dt>
          <dd>When a new employee is hired, an entry will be added to this list. <br>
            Staff are responsible for adding/maintaining this list. <br>
            So certain staff will need access to this list. <br>
            Kicks off a flow when item is added to this list.</dd>
          <br/>
          <dt>
             <b>OnboardingTracker</b></dt>
          <dd>This list will be populated with tasks for internal staff once a new hire <br>
            has been entered into the OnboardingInputForm. The list that feeds this one <br>
            is WFOnboardingTasks. Staff will update their status of items in this list <br>
            as they work them so staff will need access to this list. <br>
            Flow will be kicked off as items are added.</dd>
          <br/>
          <dt>
             <b>NewHireTasks</b></dt>
          <dd>Tasks for the new hires will be assigned and added to this list once they've <br>
            been added into the OnboardingInputForm list. <br>
            Tasks will be sourced from the WFEmployeeOnboardingTasks list via a flow. <br>
            No flows will be kicked off from this list.</dd>
          <br/>
       </dl>
       <p>What is the order of operation?</p>
       <ol>
          <li>Populate WFOnboardingTasks with items that will be assigned to internal staff</li>
          <li>Populate WFEmployeeOnboardingTasks with items that will be assigned to the new hire</li>

          <li>New employee gets hired, make an entry into the OnboardingInputForm list</li>
          <li>OnboardingTracker list will get populated with internal staff assignments</li>
          <li>Emails will be sent to staff assigned to items being added to OnboardingTracker</li>
